## Hex Bugs curve

Both of the kids got (more) HexBugs as presents this Christmas, and it seemed
like a good time to try and print up some extra track. This was a first attempt
at using an existing model of a standard curved track:

While the dimensions of the print are close, the curvature of the track is more
acute than the commercial HexBugs track, making it incompatible for certain track
arrangements, most notably a loop.

Also interesting: this model is done at very small scale - Cura automatically scales
it up by a factor of _10,000_ when the model is imported.
