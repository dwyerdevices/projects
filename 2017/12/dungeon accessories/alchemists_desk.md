### Alchemists Desk

A city and dungeon in the planning stages both call for a few alchemists; some of

At default scale these don't print well - the drawers don't print out completely, and the equipment
on the desk is too fragile, falling apart at the barest touch. Scaled up to 150% 
they print perfectly - the drawers slide cleanly, and the desk fits almost exactly
in a 2x1 dungeon tile.
