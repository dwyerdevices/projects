## Lotsa Boxes

I needed eight to 10 small containers for holding Legos for a large build:

the individual boxes are from a simple, yet elegant design of boxes meant to
stack and hold small parts like screws, nails, and mixed electronic components:

Four boxes fit nicely onto the build plate, but I probably could have squeezed in 
six or eight in a single print, if I had been willing to wait out the 6+ hours
the print would have taken before being able to hold a finished box in my
hands to make sure they worked well.
