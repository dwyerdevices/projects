## Squishy Owl

The test print of the NinjaFlex went smoothly, so onto the squishy owl. This is a Christmas present
for the 5 year old.

A few false starts, and some fiddling with live z-tuning, and things were printing well. The first print
is nearly perfect, except for the top of the head, where there are too few layers, and too big of a gap
to bridge:

Trying a small second version with a few extra layers, sliced in Slic3r so I can better control a few
things. Well, that resulted in nothing printed, and a bundle of twisted and wasted filament.

Added a tophat to see if we can cover up the spotty quality on the top of the owl's head:
