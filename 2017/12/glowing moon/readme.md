### Alternate Moon - the Glowing Moon

I've seen a lot of 3D printed glowing moons for sale on various Etsy shops, and
all over Instagram, and wanted to print one for the 10 year old for Christmas. After
a few [failed moon prints](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2018/01/01/moon-lamp-failures/) I finally
found a design that would work.

Pre-scaled to the right size, and with explicit printing instructions about not rescaling to
avoid missing layers (and failed prints), this print turned out beautifully. With solid enough
walls to create a really nice shadowing effect for the craters on the moon surface.

The moon itself took a little over 30 hours to print, and a custom base to fit an Ikea touch
lamp added another few hours, but the finished version was worth it:
