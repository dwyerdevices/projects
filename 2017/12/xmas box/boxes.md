## Gift Boxes

A few gift boxes for small presents.

The scaled down version was intended for small gifts, like jewelry, but ended up
being very hard to close, and even harder to open. Seems like the mixture of scaling
and print quality didn't lend itself to the original tolerances between the top and
bottom of the box.

The Gift Card size box turns out to be fairly quick to print, and well sized for
jewelry:

To get really clean prints of the gift-card box I rotated the top and
bottom before slicing, to minimize supports connected to the outside of the box.

In the end, the red and white gift-card sized boxes went under the tree.
