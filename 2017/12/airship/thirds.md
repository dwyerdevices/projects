### Airship 1 - Model Errors

I recently backed the [RPG Tool Wargaming Printable Items](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1978496658/rpg-tools-rpg-wargame-3d-printable-items) Kickstarter,
and received the model files in mid December. I've started to make my way through the models,
printing as many of them as look interesting. Quite a lot of the models are supplied
as components that can be combined to create more complex and varied structures.

Why not start with an airship? This is a large, multi-part model that will take some time
to piece together.

I started printing this airship from a base model that was split into three parts. Cleanup
of the first part I printed (the rear third) took a fair amount of time, and while the details
of the ship body looked nice, some issues were becoming apparent:

The prints took a bit more than 2x longer than expected, and it looks like the models had
surface normalization issues prior to slicing, with large chunks of the three base pieces missing
in the printed versions. Salvagable, but we'll need to fix the files and reprint for a
full version of the airship.

Comparing the model and printed version of the rear third of the ship:

And the center third:

And the front third:

The airship was also included split into two model files, which fit into the printable
volume of my printer with only a few centimeters to spare. I'll be detailing that build
in a separate post.
