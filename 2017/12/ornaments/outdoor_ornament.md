#### Five Intersecting Tetrahedra

Can I print a solid, interesting, and decent quality large scale ornament suitable for outdoor
use during the holidays?

I used an ornament design that was provided with built in supports, which made sense for
the complex geometry. I scaled up the print to 175% of original, with a final print size of
 148mm x 147mm x 122.5mm.

The print is a little rough - the pre-fit supports weren't designed for a print at 175% scale,
so there is some drooping filament, and the attachment points for the supports don't separate
cleanly. But it's still clean enough when viewed at a distance, and will fit (scale wise) with
other outdoor ornaments we have.
