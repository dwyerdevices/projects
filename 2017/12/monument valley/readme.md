## Full Scale Totem

I really enjoyed the look and quality of the [Monument Valley Totem model I printed
at half scale](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/10/31/monument-valley-totem/), and
decided shortly after that print that a full scale print of the model was in order.

I quickly printed the first pieces, and it was clear that at full scale, this was
going to be a large Totem:

The larger pieces each took a few hours to print over a few days, and I had started
cleaning up the supports I had printed for the cubic body pieces, when I had a bit
of a mishap that landed me in urgent care:

While I waited for the cut to heal, and stitches to get taken out, build out of the
full Totem model was put on hold. Other things needed printing, and Totem ended up
on a shelf until a little more than a month later, when I finally finished the
clean up of the prints, and glued all of the surface details in place:

The glue cured overnight, and the next morning I snapped the pieces together:

Unlike the 50% scale print, where the prongs of the ring joint completely snapped
off, resulting in the print being glued together, only a tiny number of the ring
joint prongs broke during assembly of the full scale version.
