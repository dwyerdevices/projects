## Filament spool clips


If you're switching between filaments, you need something to keep the spool from unwinding. This
model set is incredibly useful: a super simple, super quick filament clip with variations for a
bunch of different spool shapes and sizes. With a quick modification prior to slicing, it's also 
very easy to print out multiples.

This model is fast enough and small enough that I end up using it to test new filaments or print
settings, prior to running larger and longer prints. A model like this should be included in the
SD Card that ships with the Prusa i3.

The low profile of the clip works well when stacking and storing spools. I wedge a bunch of 
spools together when I store them in an air-tight container, and I have yet to accidentally dislodge
a clip.
