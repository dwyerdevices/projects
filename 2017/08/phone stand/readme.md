Cell phone stand seem to be a dime-a-dozen on Thingiverse. I decided to try this one out because it
looked like it would maintain good balance, fit my iPhone with it's case, and provided a slot to plug
in a charging cable while on the stand. So far I have no complaints.

This was one of my first multi-hour prints after getting my Prusa i3 mk2, and was a fairly easy
and straightforward print. This was also the first time I tried the _pause print_ feature, leaving
the partially completed print over night and resuming the next morning. There is a layer that is
ever so slightly offset where the printer resumed, but otherwise flawless pause and restart.
