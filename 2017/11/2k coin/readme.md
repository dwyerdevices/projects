## 2km Coin

I had a spool of gold ABS loaded into the printer after helping the 10 year old
print up some gold bars and coins for a school project. I don't have many things
that get printed in gold, and I don't particularly want this spool to sit around
and age without using it up - so I pondered what I might print in gold. As a happy
coincidence, what ever I did end up printing with the gold would likely push the
printer over the 2 kilometers of printed filament mark. Time for another coin
to celebrate!
