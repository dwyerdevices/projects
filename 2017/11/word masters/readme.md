## Word Masters

The 10 year old is building a vault full of gems, coins, and gold bars as part of a project to
come up with a 3D representation of the word **skinflint**. An hour or so in TinkerCad, and he
was ready to print.

After about 5 print failures laying down the brim and base layer for the set of four gold bars,
I gave in and tried blue painters tape on the print bed. I can't believe how cleanly ABS went
down on the tape...
