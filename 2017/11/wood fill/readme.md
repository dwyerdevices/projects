## Wood Fill Test

Printing a simple test pattern with Hatchbox Wood Fill. This wood fill is a blend with standard PLA, but
I'm trying out a PrusaControl slicer preset for ColorFabb wood fill, to see if the heat, speed, and retraction
settings work equally well for Hatchbox.

Hmm - not the cleanest print on the test tile, but the brim was super smooth and clean. Will need to 
play with slicer settings and printer z adjustments for the full piece I want to print. I like the finish
and aesthetic of the wood fill, so I hope it works well for a few other prints, and one or two special
pieces I want to put together.
