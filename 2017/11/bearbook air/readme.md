## BearBook Air

The 10 year old and I have strange conversations as I'm turning out his light and closing his door
at bed time. Half stall-tactics, half clearing his brain from the day, these sometimes short (sometimes not)
conversations range far and wide, from dissecting the day, to gaming, to story telling and general goofiness.

One Friday night the conversation settled on his teddy bear, and how said bear really wanted a laptop of his
own so he could play Minecraft. By the end of the weekend the BearBook Air was ready:

This model went through a few iterations over Saturday and Sunday. In the first version The model didn't fit 
together, despite trying to scale the shells up by 5% to see if they could fit the other components:

Not a terrible start, but a bunch of things needed changing and fixing:

 - The shell thickness was too thin to usefully print, and needed to be increased to 1cm thick
 - The first version of the hinge was too complicated, needing drastic simplification to print
 - The pivot attachment points on both shells needed to be rethought
 - The keyboard, when printed, was only about 4 layers thick, and needed to be extruded further

Those changes took an hour or two, and version two was much cleaner. Some of the pieces still need a bit
of post-print work to fit; the hinge needs to be sanded to fit, as does the keyboard. Overall, a good
weekend project.
