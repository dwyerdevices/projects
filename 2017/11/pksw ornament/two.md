#### PKSW Ornament - Pieces

The solution to really messy edging and surface detail from [the solid ornament](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/11/12/holiday-ornament-first-draft/) is solvable
by breaking the beveled letters apart into individual chunks, with the letter face toward the print bed. 
Having the letter surface on the print bed will guarantee a smooth surface, especially with translucent
filaments, where even minor layer variations are very noticable. Clean, crisp lines are easier when you aren't
fighting gravity.

Now all of the pieces are joined by a pillar through the middle of the ornament, with each letter having
a tab sticking into the middle of the ornament, with the pillar threaded through.

The first pass print of the ornament in pieces had a few problems: the brim made for jagged edges on
otherwise nice and smooth letter faces, the supports were hard to clean up and tore off the hook on the
pillar, and the pillar was just barely too wide, and wouldn't fit in past the first letter and into the rest of the pieces.

The second pass is just about right: no brim, so the edges of the letters were clean, and  a slightly thinner
column to fit through all of the letter tabs. A few tweaks, and we're ready to try out a bunch of materials.
