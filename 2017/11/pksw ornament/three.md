#### PKSW Individual Prints

Final draft of the holiday ornament. Tolerances are perfect, and everything stays in place with just tension. Going to try a few prints at higher quality to see if the extra print time has a worthwhile effect. Almost time to crank out a dozen or so of these.

Initially this was meant to include four different translucent colors, one for each letter, but 
for whatever reason the translucent orange is proving really hard to work with, regularly jamming
the extruder and not adhering to the print bed. The translucent green has similar problems. A Z 
re-calibration and z live-tuning makes a difference for the green filament, but doesn't seem
to help the orange. After a few trial prints, I settled on using two colors, red and green. Festive!

This was a really fun model to build - fairly straight forward to measure and
setup, but intricate enough to be interesting. The pillar in this version is designed to be ~1mm 
smaller in diameter than the through-hole of each of the letter pieces, providing just enough
wiggle room to get each of the letters on the pillar, after which tension keeps everything in place.
