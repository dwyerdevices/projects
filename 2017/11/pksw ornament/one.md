#### PKSW Ornament - Single Object

With Christmas fast approaching, I decided to start designing our family ornament
for the year. I wanted it to be simple, but interesting, and identifiably _us_. I settled
on a fairly simple shape with each of our first initials beveled into a cube. 

At full scale this was a long print, and the supports were a nightmare. Printing letters vertically makes for
a really messy surface on all the sides. I need to find a cleaner way to print these.
