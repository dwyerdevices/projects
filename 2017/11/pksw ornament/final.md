### PKSW Final Draft

After two full redesigns, three rounds of print testing, and completely re-selecting
materials, the holiday ornaments were ready. A short batch of print runs was enough
to build ornaments for the handful of friends and family we want to gift them too.

The final print runs took a bit under 24 hours, but overall I'd estimate that I spent
10+ hours designing and revising the ornament model, and 35-40 hours in printing time
between the drafts and final prints.

Things I learned:

 - It's hard to get repeatable, high quality PETG prints without a lot of tuning and
  trouble shooting. It's far easier to select a filament like PLA, which will result
  in much more reliable print quality.
 - For snap fit parts even small increments in layer size can have a large effect on
  the outcome: at 0.35mm layer size these ornaments take brute force to fit, while 
  0.20mm layer size results in clean, snug, snap fits.
 - TinkerCad will get non-responsive really quickly when building models with multiple
  complex positive and negative space groupings.
