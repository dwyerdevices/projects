## Sewer Dungeon Filler - Take 1

The [Sewer Dungeon](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/11/01/the-sewer-dungeon/) has been a phenomenal success, but I've come up short more than a few stone tiles. I tried
printing up a few batches of various tiles arrangements, and had mixed success. Printing ABS near the edges of
the printer still ends up in print failure more often than not, as the ABS curls and pulls away from the bed, blocking
the print head and ruining the print. Those that were successful were batch prints that kept to the center of the print bed.

About half way through the process I also ran out of gray ABS; thinking I had a spare roll tucked away, I hadn't
ordered a new batch. After more filament comes in, the catch-up printing will continue.
