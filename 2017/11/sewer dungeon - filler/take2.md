## Sewer Dungeon Filler - Take 2

Being as woefully short on tiles as I've been so far when dungeon planning and printing meet
the reality of the gaming table, I decided to revisit the plan for the next section of dungeon
the adventures will encounter- and sure enough, significantly short on floor tiles.

This batch of six 3x4 stone tiles should do nicely. Thankfully I got a new shipment of the
gray filament I've been using for floor tiles in earlier this week:

That should cover the next few dungeons.
