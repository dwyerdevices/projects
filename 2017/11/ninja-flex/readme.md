## NinjaFlex Test

Picked up a new flexible filament, so I'm running a test print of a small pyramid with NinjaFlex.

Pyramid test print turned out really well - the print took exactly as long as estimated, the
shell wall of the pyramid was strong but still flexible, and the finish on the print was clean,
with visible but thin layer lines.

Loading was _almost_ a problem. The extruder had ABS wedged in it after a previous spool had
a tangle and a snap. The first try at loading the NinjaFlex managed to push out most of the ABS,
but backed up the NinjaFlex into a ball. The jam pulled out easily, and the second attempt at
loading was quick and easy - luckily the ball of NinjaFlex hadn't melted at all, and was completely
reusable.
