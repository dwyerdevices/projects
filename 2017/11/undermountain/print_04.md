## Undermountain Dungeon - Print 4

We're building another dungeon, this time the Undermountain. The Undermountain is a series of
tunnels and rooms that once belonged to a dwarven stronghold, but have been taken over by an
ancient wyrm and its devout goblin worshipers. This is a project spanning lots of different prints, until
we generate all of the tiles we need for the dungeon we have in mind. The prints
are spread across:

 - Print One - [Enter the Undermountain](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/10/19/undermountain-dungeon-print-1/)
 - Print Two - [The Sundered Spire](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/10/24/undermountain-dungeon-print-2/)
 - Print Three - [Portals](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2018/01/07/undermountain-dungeon-print-3/)
 - Print Four - [Destroyed Portal - The Vortex]()
 
### Print 4 - Destroyed Portal - The Vortex

The [Sundered Spire](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/10/24/undermountain-dungeon-print-2/) sits before
a short hallway, at the end of which was once another portal. Whatever managed to destroy the spire
seems to have also destroyed the portal - where once a magic circle would have been etched into the
floor is now a swirling pool of water, at its center a never ending vortex of water leading down:

Where does the water go? Where does the water _come from_? Hopefully our adventurers never find out.
