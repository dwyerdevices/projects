## Undermountain Dungeon - Print 3

We're building another dungeon, this time the Undermountain. The Undermountain is a series of
tunnels and rooms that once belonged to a dwarven stronghold, but have been taken over by an
ancient wyrm and its devout goblin worshipers. This is a project spanning lots of different prints, until
we generate all of the tiles we need for the dungeon we have in mind. The prints
are spread across:

 - Print One - [Enter the Undermountain](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/10/19/undermountain-dungeon-print-1/)
 - Print Two - [The Sundered Spire](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/10/24/undermountain-dungeon-print-2/)
 - Print Three - [Portals](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2018/01/07/undermountain-dungeon-print-3/)

### Print 3 - Portals

The adventurers have been pulled through a portal from the [Sewer Dungeon](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/11/01/the-sewer-dungeon/), 
and into the Undermountain. Ahead of them lies the portal chamber, with three other hallways leading to what can only be more
portals. Dominating the portal chamber are a set of obelisks, one for each hallway. Three of the obelisks stand tall, with a barely
discernable glow, while another is sundered, the cracked spire fallen to the side of hte obelisk plinth.

At the end of two of the unexplored hallways are portals, each faintly glowing- one blue as the sky, the other the yellow of sand left
to bake in the sun.

The completed portals are embedded in a 4x4 gray exterior:
