## Troubleshooting - woodfill jam

I was experimenting with Hatchbox Wood-fill PLA, printing up some dungeon accessories, when an unfortunate
thing happened. The wood fill cooled in the extruder, over heated with a small backup at the nozzle, and BAM
- fully jammed hotend.

The Prusa i3 ships with a small packet containing two acupuncture needles, which are the ideal size for
clearing jammed material from a 0.4mm hot end. It's difficult to find _anything_ else that is the right
size and durability, and acupuncture needles are hard to acquire. After a day of trying to clear the
jammed wood-fill with various combinations of other materials, Kelly found (and ordered) perfectly
sized [0.4mm drill bits](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072JJ7H5P/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

A day or two later I had the drill bits in hand, and within minutes the jam was cleared, burnt wood fill and
all:

I'm going to keep a set of these in my printing kit from now on.
