### Work benches

These models are ridiculously complex surfaces, so slicers (at least PrusaControl and Slic3r) will
have a hard time processing the model meshes if you attempt to batch print more than one or two full 
work benches at the same time. For the smaller benches I printed two tops and bottoms in a single
print, while for the 1x3 and 1x4 I printed single tops and bottoms as a pair.

I tried out the Hatchbox Wood-fill filament I had on hand for the first set of benches:

While the benches are sturdy, the flat surfaces are a mess - detail is lost, and cleanup was
a minor nightmare of wispy filament and rough edges.

I printed the larger 1x3 and 1x4 benches in standard PLA, with much better results:

And why a turquoise bench? The wood fill jammed part way through a print, and the turquoise was
on hand as I was cleaning out the burnt woodfill. Rather than unload that filament and risk not
having purged the hot end and extruder of jammed material, I ran a full bench print in turquoise.
