### Crates and Barrels

What's a dungeon complex without random crates of material and barrels strewn around
for the adventurers to dig through and hide behind? I wanted a small set of various
cover items that would work well in different settings; dungeons, alleyways, docks.

I'm incredibly happy with how these turned out - I think this solidifies the need to
print accessory and one off items at a higher quality than standard tiles that need
to be turned out by the dozen. Accessory items and show pieces get an inordinate amount
of attention from the players - and the pieces are just nicer to look at when printed 
at higher quality.
