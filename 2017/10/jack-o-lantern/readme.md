## Makies Jack-o-Lantern

It was edging close to Halloween, and I just happened to have some translucent green and translucent
orange filament on hand (imagine that), so a Jack-o-lantern seemed appropriate:

Lit with a small LED, it had a nice glow to it:

This is one of only a handful of models I've need to _scale up_ for printing. In this case I wanted to
fit a tea candle LED, which required scaling up to 150% of original size to get the LED through the
opening at the top of the pumpkin.
