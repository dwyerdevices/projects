## Print Fail - Trapped TPE

I picked up a small roll (0.5kg) of a translucent blue TPE flex filament to
try out, and started with a dead simple rectangle as the sample print. Probably
wise that I started with something small:

Fairly certain that's not where the filament is supposed to go. Clipping the loose
filament, and opening up the pressure latch for the extruder stepper, I was able
to pull out the jammed TPE filament.

The filament that remained in the extruder and hot end pushed out cleanly when I
setup a spool of ABS and loaded the new filament.
