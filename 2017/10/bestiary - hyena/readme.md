## Bestiary - Goblin Dog

I'm going to use Hyenas as a proxy for Goblin Dogs in this adventure. I wanted a decent sized pack, so 
setup a print with six copies of the small hyena:

There was a ton of clean up for these, and being delicate, two of them didn't make it. That's why I started
with six, though. The base of the support plate under the Hyena at the base of the figurine still has a few 
layers of support material on it, which I'm not going to clean up, otherwise I'd probably lose most of the rest of the figurines.

The Hatchbox Copper ABS loaded a bit strangely; lots of popping and hissing as the hotend heated up, and 
the extruded filament almost looks aerated. The print came out a bit stringy as well - I may need to play
with the print temperature for this filament to get better results.
