## Totem and Ida

Everyone in the house has played, and often continues to play, Monument Valley. It felt
like the house needed a Totem friend of its own.

This Totem is at half scale from the original model, primarily to speed up printing time.

I also combined models that are the same color into single prints to make the logistics
a bit easier, as otherwise there are 14 separate pieces to print.

The only problem I ran into printing at half scale is with the snap together rotating
joint: at this scale the individual prongs aren't strong enough to latch into place
without snapping. I ended up glueing the cubes together after all of the prongs
crumbled.
