## Bestiary - Crocodiles

The upcoming adventure through the sewers requires a creature(s) lurking in the deep, murky pools
into which the sluices empty. How about crocodiles?

Choosing crocodiles was honestly fairly round-about, given how obvious crocs-in-the-sewers
should be; I spent 10 minutues paging through the Bestiary looking for an appropriate aquatic
menace that could lurk in the sewer pools.


This is my first print from [YouMagine](https://www.youmagine.com), but given how many creatures
I've already found there, I doubt my last. I comfortably fit two small crocodiles on the build
plate, but had I needed more, I'd guess 8-12 could be wedged onto a 200mm x 200mm plate.
