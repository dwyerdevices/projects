## Blade of Marmora

Voltron is kind of a big deal in this house. So, it's natural that, come Halloween, I
needed to print a Blade of Marmora so one of us could be Keith. The blade, along with
a few other costume bits, will also serve well as cosplay for upcoming Cons. 

The model for this blade is by [Billy the Brick](http://billythebrick.storenvy.com/),
and cost [$9.95](http://billythebrick.storenvy.com/products/18957625-voltron-prop-keith-galra-dagger-for-cosplay-stl-files-for-3d-printing) - well
worth it for a high quality model that is incredibly easy to print and fit together.

### Printing

I'm going to pick materials for the various components of this model that elimintates
the need to do any painting, or at least minimizes the amount of painting required on
the finished blade. Eventually we'll build a version with an embedded battery and electronics
to make the gem stone glow, but for now a non-glowing translucent blue gemstone will need to do.

### Sanding

All of the printed pieces required sanding; the blade pieces so that they would align
and fuse tightly, the blade guard so it would form a snug fit with the pommel and blade
shaft, and the gem so it would seat properly:

### Constructing

The blade is aligned by a 0.25" wood dowel run through the center of each piece. All of the
components are held together with KrazyGlue, which should provide [more than enough strength](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/11/04/glue-tests/)
for the shear forces that will be applied to the blade.

### Finishing

To even out some of the print layer striations, and add a bit of gloss, I used [XTC-3D](https://www.smooth-on.com/products/xtc-3d/) as
a finish coat, which took about 4 hours to dry, and overnight to full set.

For future prints I may try combining the two models that form the blade to see
if I can get a solid blade with no visible join.
