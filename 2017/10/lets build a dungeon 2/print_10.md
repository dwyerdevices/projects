## OpenForge - Sewer Dungeon

We're building a dungeon. This is a project spanning lots of different prints, until
we generate all of the tiles we need for the dungeon we have in mind. The prints
are spread across:

 - Print One - [Sewer Corners](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/24/sewer-dungeon-print-one/)
 - Print Two - [Sewer Tunnel](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/24/sewer-dungeon-print-two/)
 - Print Three - [Corners and Ladders](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/24/sewer-dungeon-print-three/)
 - Print Four - [Deep Pool](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/24/sewer-dungeon-print-4/)
 - Print Five - [Deep Sluice and Deep Pool](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/29/sewer-dungeon-print-five/)
 - Print Six - [Barred Sewer](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/29/sewer-dungeon-print-six/)
 - Print Seven - [ABS Flooring](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/29/sewer-dungeon-print-seven/)
 - Print Eight - [Circular Room Part 1](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/10/02/sewer-dungeon-print-eight/)
 - Print Nine - [Circular Room Part 2](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/10/03/sewer-dungeon-print-nine/)
 - Print Ten - [Circular Room Part 3](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/10/05/sewer-dungeon-print-ten/)
 - Print Eleven - [Bridges](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/10/06/sewer-dungeon-print-eleven/)
 - Print Twelve - [So Much Sluice](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/10/08/sewer-dungeon-print-twelve/)
 - Print Thirteen - [Magic Portal](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/10/14/sewer-dungeon-print-thirteen/)


### Print Ten - Circular Room Part 3

Finishing off the structure of the circular room, we have a door and some floor space. I've printed
the floors before, so those were fairly easy to setup and finish. The door frame and door were different. Like
the [barred sewer](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/29/sewer-dungeon-print-six/) the pieces need to
be joined together to finish off the model.

The layer size for this print (0.35mm) made the doors only a few layers thick, with a very rough hole to fit
wire through to attach the door to the frame. To attach the two halves of the door together, I used [Super 77](https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/company-us/all-3m-products/~/3M-Super-77-Multipurpose-Spray-Adhesive?N=5002385+3293242460&rt=rud) to
bond the two pieces of ABS together. The super smooth surface of the two door halves made this fairly easy, although I did
end up with various bits of paper towel stuck to things for the next few hours, as the spray nozzle of the Super 77 wasn't
terribly clean.

It seems fairly trivial to join the door frame and door, but up until now I haven't found a good, maleable, and
easy to work with wire that was still durable enough to not immediately fall apart with use. I ended up using
a spool of project wire from a home improvement store. The wire was easy to bend into rough shape by hand, but
needed tools for making clean folds. To attach the door I doubled up the top end of the wire, such that the thicker
portion of the wire wedged firmly into the top of the door frame - secure, but not visible without close inspection. The
remainder of the wire was thin enough, and strong enough, to form a axle for the door to swing on.
