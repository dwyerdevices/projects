## OpenForge - Sewer Dungeon

We're building a dungeon. This is a project spanning lots of different prints, until
we generate all of the tiles we need for the dungeon we have in mind. The prints
are spread across:

 - Print One - [Sewer Corners](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/24/sewer-dungeon-print-one/)
 - Print Two - [Sewer Tunnel](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/24/sewer-dungeon-print-two/)
 - Print Three - [Corners and Ladders](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/24/sewer-dungeon-print-three/)
 - Print Four - [Deep Pool](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/24/sewer-dungeon-print-4/)
 - Print Five - [Deep Sluice and Deep Pool](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/29/sewer-dungeon-print-five/)

### Print Eight - Circular Room Part 1

A circular room inset in a larger dungeon is going to play a part in this upcoming adventure. This
print covers the curved walls of the room, while a series of future prints will add in the outside
tiles to square out our floor against the curved wall, as well as a door, some straight walls, and
a few filler floor tiles.

The curves are 3x3, eventually making the room feel fairly large.
