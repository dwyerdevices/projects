## OpenForge - Sewer Dungeon

We're building a dungeon. This is a project spanning lots of different prints, until
we generate all of the tiles we need for the dungeon we have in mind. The prints
are spread across:

 - Print One - [Sewer Corners](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/24/sewer-dungeon-print-one/)
 - Print Two - [Sewer Tunnel](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/24/sewer-dungeon-print-two/)
 - Print Three - [Corners and Ladders](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/24/sewer-dungeon-print-three/)
 - Print Four - [Deep Pool](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/24/sewer-dungeon-print-4/)
 - Print Five - [Deep Sluice and Deep Pool](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/29/sewer-dungeon-print-five/)
 - Print Six - [Barred Sewer](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/29/sewer-dungeon-print-six/)
 - Print Seven - [ABS Flooring](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/29/sewer-dungeon-print-seven/)
 - Print Eight - [Circular Room Part 1](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/10/02/sewer-dungeon-print-eight/)
 - Print Nine - [Circular Room Part 2](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/10/03/sewer-dungeon-print-nine/)
 - Print Ten - [Circular Room Part 3](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/10/05/sewer-dungeon-print-ten/)
 - Print Eleven - [Bridges](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/10/06/sewer-dungeon-print-eleven/)
 - Print Twelve - [So Much Sluice](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/10/08/sewer-dungeon-print-twelve/)
 - Print Thirteen - [Magic Portal](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/10/14/sewer-dungeon-print-thirteen/)
 
### Print Thirteen - Magic Portal

This dungeon has a larger purpose; a magical portal at the end of the dungeon hints
at a bigger dungeon complex, and story, yet to unfold. This model is an excellent
self contained magic circle that will fit into the existing dungeon layout without
much trouble.

I'm trying a few new print settings for this print. First off, I'm using the 3D honey
comb fill, which should create a stronger infill with less material than other infill
patterns. In an effort to reduce print time even further, I'm testing out Slic3r's feature
for doing thicker infill layers. In this mode the perimeter layers are printed at the
configured layer size (in this case 0.35mm), but the infill layers are printed thicker,
and only laid down every 3 layers.

The combined infill parameters had me a bit wary after the print first started. With a
basic layer quality of 0.35mm, and combined fill every 3 layers, the infill height would
seem to be 1.05mm, which is more than double the extruder size. I've kept a close eye
on the print, and so far everything seems to be working, but the honeycomb infill does
have visible vertical gaps between each layer.

This is also the first print where I've needed to swap in a new filament spool mid
print. The switch was easy, but waiting for the right moment, wasting as little filament
from the old spool, was time consuming.
