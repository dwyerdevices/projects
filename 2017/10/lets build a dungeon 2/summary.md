Over the course of a month we built a sizable dungeon for the start of our Pathfinder
campaign. Traipsing about in the sewers will be a recurring activity during the course
of the campaign, albeit it in a variety of different sewers. 

The thirteen prints to build this dungeon went from 
small (a few [sewer corners](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/24/sewer-dungeon-print-one/)) to large ( [40 hours of sluice](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/10/08/sewer-dungeon-print-twelve/) ), and included basic tiles that will be
reused throughout this and other campaigns, as well as a few specialty pieces ( a [barred sewer entrance](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/29/sewer-dungeon-print-six/) and [bridges](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/10/06/sewer-dungeon-print-eleven/) )
that give the sewer dungeon its character.

The players have already entered the sewers, where they are (at the time of writing) facing off against
a deep pool full of crocodiles:

Printing this dungeon has been a fantastic way to explore Thingiverse and YouMagine, and has provided
excellent practice in planning and executing prints with a ton of pieces.

Each of the print posts below has details on the files, settings, and frustrations that went
into each component of the sewer dungeon. Some high level details:


 - **105 hours 14 minutes** of printing     
 - **744.4 meters** of filament
 - **151** indiviual pieces printed 
 - **~ $0.18 per tile**, on average
 - **$27.92** for the whole dungeon
