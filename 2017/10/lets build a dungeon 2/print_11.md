## OpenForge - Sewer Dungeon

We're building a dungeon. This is a project spanning lots of different prints, until
we generate all of the tiles we need for the dungeon we have in mind. The prints
are spread across:

 - Print One - [Sewer Corners](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/24/sewer-dungeon-print-one/)
 - Print Two - [Sewer Tunnel](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/24/sewer-dungeon-print-two/)
 - Print Three - [Corners and Ladders](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/24/sewer-dungeon-print-three/)
 - Print Four - [Deep Pool](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/24/sewer-dungeon-print-4/)
 - Print Five - [Deep Sluice and Deep Pool](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/29/sewer-dungeon-print-five/)
 - Print Six - [Barred Sewer](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/29/sewer-dungeon-print-six/)
 - Print Seven - [ABS Flooring](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/29/sewer-dungeon-print-seven/)
 - Print Eight - [Circular Room Part 1](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/10/02/sewer-dungeon-print-eight/)
 - Print Nine - [Circular Room Part 2](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/10/03/sewer-dungeon-print-nine/)
 - Print Ten - [Circular Room Part 3](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/10/05/sewer-dungeon-print-ten/)
 - Print Eleven - [Bridges](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/10/06/sewer-dungeon-print-eleven/)

### Print Eleven - Bridges

No one _wants_ to walk through sluices, much less (possibly) bottomless pools
in the sewers, right? Wouldn't it be nice if there were a way across the deep
streams and pools? Well, it looks like someone built bridges in this old sewer system, I wonder
why? And why do the bridges look newer, with different stone, than the old sewers? Who puts new
bridges in an old sewer?

The three bridges are the largest single print for the entire dungeon, clocking in at a bit above
12 hours. Despite generous brims and glue, the outer edges of the bridge still pulled away from
the print bed. Not a big deal for these tiles, but a problem to solve none-the-less.

Supports were a necessity for the shallow slope of the underside of the bridge, but were very
easy to remove.
