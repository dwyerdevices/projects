### Lego Angles

While it's possible to hack together LEGO solutions for strange angles and
shapes, wouldn't it be nice to have pre-built blocks to help build the
[regular polygons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polygon)? 

I've had my eye on the various LEGO compatible SCAD files and customizers, and
decided to try [one of them out](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:615256). Using a simple 2x2 plate block as the foundation,
I built a block with a 108Â° inner angle that can be used to form pentagons:

The first batch of pentagon angles didn't fit terribly well with standard legos. Too loose when
connected to the base of a Lego, too tight and unable to snap in when placed on top of a standard
Lego. It's possible the nub holes and through-hole on the plate were an issue, so I printed a few
test pieces of different heights and features to see what worked best.

For the next set of blocks, I'll try a different template block or SCAD/customizer to
see if it has better dimensions and tolerance.
