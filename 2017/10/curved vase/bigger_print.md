## Another Vase

Another curved vase, like the [50% scaled vase](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/10/17/miniature-curved-vase/), this time
a bit bigger, a bit stronger, and a different color:

My goal for this print of the vase was something big enough to hold pens and pencils. It needed to be sturdy
enough to withstand daily abuse from children as well; with this print I increased the number of wall perimeters
to 5, instead of the default of 2. Overall a good print - clean lines, the right size, and dense enough for
daily use by everyone in the family.

The estimate for print time and material for this model as sliced are off by slightly more than 50% because
PrusaControl (which I've been using to generate time and material estimates, even when using Slic3r to generate
GCODE) doesn't offer a way to modify options like perimeter count, leading to sometimes wildly wrong estimates.
