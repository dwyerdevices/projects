## Miniature Curved Vase

I've wanted to try out vase models, and the Slic3r settings needed to make them. This
vase in particular, I want to use as a pen holder.

At 50% scale it's a bit small as a pen jar, but it'll work well as a small flower/bud vase. The default
perimeter thickness makes it a bit fragile, as does the default number of layers at the bottom
of the vase. I'll need to tinker with those a bit to get another solid print.
