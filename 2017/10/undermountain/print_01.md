## Undermountain Dungeon - Print 1

We're building another dungeon, this time the Undermountain. The Undermountain is a series of
tunnels and rooms that once belonged to a dwarven stronghold, but have been taken over by an
ancient wyrm and its devout goblin worshipers. This is a project spanning lots of different prints, until
we generate all of the tiles we need for the dungeon we have in mind. The prints
are spread across:

 - Print One - [Enter the Undermountain](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/10/19/undermountain-dungeon-print-1/)

### Enter the Undermountain

Where does the [magical portal from the sewers](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/10/14/sewer-dungeon-print-thirteen/) go? 
To a small cavern, with small tunnels for four portals surrounding an altar chisled from stone. Welcome to the Undermountain.

I'll print the underlying tiles and corridor walls as the larger dungeon takes shape. Three of the four
portal entrances to the Undermountain are controlled by magical spires:

Each of the portal chambers have a single hallway, leading to an altar cut from stone:
