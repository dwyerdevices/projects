## Bestiary - Ghosts

Why wouldn't you want to have a set of green ghosts around? Especially if your adventurers might
be snooping around tombs. Ancient tombs, at that. There may even be mummies about. Boo.

The ghosts were hard to clean up. None of the heads came through attached, and on one of the ghosts the arms 
came off with the supports. They'll still work (ok, _headless_ ghosts) for the purpose of this adventure, but
I do need to figure out a better way to print them.
