### Deck Box #1

After needing a full recalibration (that's a fun error message), and spending 20 minutes Live Adjusting the Z axis during test
prints, I could finally attempt the first of the eight prints for the CCG Deck box. It took 3 attempts, and various layer adhesion
problems, before I remembered that PETG was my nemesis, and I had to use glue stick on the print bed. With glue applied, the first
section of the box was well under way.

Print Time: 2 hours 27 minutes


### Deck Box #2

Took a few tries, but finally got a good first layer down, and the print went well after than.


### Deck Box #3

This one was weird - got a really good first layer down, and wandered off to take care of other things. Came back about
half way through the print and it looks like after the first few layers the entire print shifted half a centimeter towards
the back of the print bed. The weird part is the print is perfectly fine; the layers still had great adhesion, and the print
shifted exactly enough for the teeth of the rack gear to line up, just offset by one tooth.

### Deck Box #4

This was a long print - four gear and angle connector sections. 4+ hours. Very clean print, though.

### Deck Box #5

Easy print, no major hiccups. I might just be getting enough practice with this PETG filament.

### Deck Box #6

Left until last - changed to a Yellow PLA filament. A mostly quick print - I've had good luck so far
printing with PLA.

### Deck Box #7

Clean and easy piece to print.

Base plate is the last PETG piece to print.

## Build

The hinges and gear assembly with the rack gear make this a bit ungainly to put together. I didn't have
any metal dowling on hand, so I'm temporarily using solder wire as the pins for each of the hinge joints. The
maleable solder doesn't seem to affect the overall build quality. The snap fit for most of the parts adds
a good deal of durability to the constructed box. 

The weak point of the finished box is keeping the geared lid inline and meshed with the rack
gear for the internal lift that raises the cards out of the box: the only thing keeping the four geared
"wings" in place is a small plastic dado on each side. There was user error on my part, and on one
side the dado slipped all the way into one side of the wing, and is nearly impossible to extract. That side
of the box will need careful treatment, otherwise it'll just fall off. Ideally the plastic dado would
be longer, so that it snugly fit into each side of the wing, and should probably also be glued in
place. The wings of this build are printed from PETG, which makes glueing a bit complex: most of the
ideal adhesives are incredibly corrosive and toxic. If I end up needing to glue the wings together, I'll
probably go with a less toxic super glue like Gorilla glue or Super 77.

Overall this was a fun build: a functional (if a bit oversized) box for a Pokemon deck in about 17 hours
of print time and an hour of assembly.
