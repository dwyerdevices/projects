Our bestiary is comprised of a small number of plastic figurines, with a supplement of
cardboard creatures on stands. This upcoming adventure in the sewers is a good excuse
to expand the bestiary, and begin printing creatures we might happen upon in our
adventuring. 

I started with a dragon, which may have been optimistic. Miniatures like this can be
complex to print and cleanup, with multiple supports, small and hard to reach areas,
and sometimes delicate parts.

### First Dragon

This dragon came from the [ice dragon (repaired)](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:620234)
model on Thingiverse. I resized and rotated it in TinkerCad, and then converted to STL. The
original was scaled down to 56mm to speed up printing.

Well, that was a disaster. You'd think I'd have learned my lesson about support
structures on small, detailed prints. Alas, I hadn't (haven't), and this print
ended up in the recycling bin. 

The model itself was odd, and had a 3mm gap between the upper and lower portions
of the dragon once printed.

### Second Dragon

I thought we should try to go with a more solid bodied dragon, and do supports only on the print bed,
similarly scaled down to hopefully speed up the print:

The resulting print took about 10 minutes of careful cleanup, but turned out fairly well. The wings have patchwork
holes because of the loss of layers when scaling, which sort of adds to the overall effect.
