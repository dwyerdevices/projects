## Going Big with the Red Dragon

Let's print the [dragon](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/10/01/bestiary-red-dragon/), just bigger.

This came out beautifully, with only a few loose threads on the overhanging tail, where I 
should have added a support column. But considering the angle of the tail, that turned
out better than I could have expected. At full scale and 0.15mm layers, this is a really nice 
quality model. This is one of the longest prints I've done so far, at 20+ hours spread over
two days.

I don't think this dragon will make an appearance any time soon for our adventurers, but
it does give me some ideas of what may be to come.
