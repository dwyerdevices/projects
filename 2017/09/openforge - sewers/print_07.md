## OpenForge - Sewer Dungeon

We're building a dungeon. This is a project spanning lots of different prints, until
we generate all of the tiles we need for the dungeon we have in mind. The prints
are spread across:

 - Print One - [Sewer Corners](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/24/sewer-dungeon-print-one/)
 - Print Two - [Sewer Tunnel](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/24/sewer-dungeon-print-two/)
 - Print Three - [Corners and Ladders](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/24/sewer-dungeon-print-three/)
 - Print Four - [Deep Pool](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/24/sewer-dungeon-print-4/)
 - Print Five - [Deep Sluice and Deep Pool](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/29/sewer-dungeon-print-five/)
 - Print Six - [Barred Sewer](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/29/sewer-dungeon-print-six/)
 - Print Seven - [ABS Flooring](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/29/sewer-dungeon-print-seven/)


### Print Seven - ABS Flooring

A simple 2x2 floor piece, done in Gray ABS. This is a test piece, as I finished up a spool of
Gray PLA, and am moving on to a series of Gray ABS spools as replacements for the dungeon
prints. These simple stone floors will provide the some of the ground for the non-sewer segments of this
dungeon:

I like the density and the feel of the ABS for this tile. The color match isn't perfect (this is
a gray filament, the previous tiles were printed with a more silver filament), but the tiles
will still work really well.
