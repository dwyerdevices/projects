## OpenForge - Sewer Dungeon

We're building a dungeon. This is a project spanning lots of different prints, until
we generate all of the tiles we need for the dungeon we have in mind. The prints
are spread across:

 - Print One - [Sewer Corners]()
 - Print Two - [Sewer Tunnel]()
 - Print Three - [Corners and Ladders]()


### Print One - Corner

This print is the start of our dungeon, and also partially a test print of the sewer 
tiles. A bend in the sewer tunnel, with a covex corner as part of a larger sewer sluice pool.

Very clean print, again. These tiles are quick, easy, and very very sturdy. I had some issues 
with adhesion on the first few layers of the larger 2x2 tiles which is causing the corners to
 pull away from the print bed, but the upper surfaces of the print are unaffected.

Individual OpenForge tiles print relatively quickly, usually in 30-60 minutes each. To better
use printer time during the day, I'm combining sets of tiles together into larger prints, so
we get a collection of tiles from each print.
