## All The Clips

One of the first things I printed on my Prusa i3 was a [small set of filament clips](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/08/unwinding/) to keep
spools of filament from unwinding while they're stored in air-tight bins. Rather than print one at a time, at first I put four
copies of a single clip into a _gcode_ file, which worked out well. 

As I've tested out new filaments, I've continually forgotten to print a new batch of clips. I've also started in on spools
of filament from a range of different manufacturers, and the original set of clips I printed didn't fit some of these
spools well. 

I finally remembered that I needed to print more clips, and to save myself future headache, I went over board. I generated
a _gcode_ file with three each of all of _walter_'s [1.75mm Filament Clip](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:42528) models. 33 clips
of different shapes and sizes, hopefully enough to last for a long while.
