## Ruined Walls

Let's build a dungeon. We'll start with some basic stone surface tiles with ruined walls. Perfect
for a dilapidated building.

After our [OpenForge Test Print](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/23/openforge-test-print-curved-wall/), we're
scaling things up to print two tiles at a time. It won't optimize anything or save any print time, but it will use
available print time better as I'm away from the printer and unable to setup addition prints during the day.

This print took zero surface prep, and was a really quick print despite printing two walls at once. The hole through 
the wall ended up with a few dangling threads of filament, but they're barely noticeable. Easy print to get off the bed as well.
