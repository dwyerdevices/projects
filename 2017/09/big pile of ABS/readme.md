## That's one big pile of ABS

The first print of [All the Filaments](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/11/all-the-clips/) failed spectacularly, leaving a big ball of ABS wrapped around the hot end.

Not the best way to find the printer. I set the hot-end to pre-heat for ABS, and was able to cleanly pull the ball
off at about 120 degrees. Definitely a moment of "how did I _not_ burn the house down?"
