# Daft Trio

I think the house needed more statuary, like busts of famous musicians. Lacking a good
Bach or Mozart model, and knowing the musical leanings of our household, it seemed like
a trio of Daft Punk helmets fit the bill. I combined the three stand alone models into
a single _gcode_ file to print everything in a single print run.

This was also a chance to experiment with a new filament, [Cosmic Blue - Glow in the Dark](https://www.amazon.com/Glow-Cosmic-3D-Printing-Filament/dp/B015ZZCKW0). This is
a standard PLA filament, but feels a bit more brittle on the spool. Once printed, though, it's solid and dense.

I had zero problems with this filament, or this print. Extra thick walls on the helmets
make for a very sturdy print, and the addition of support structures makes sure the curve
of the tops of the helmets is smooth and error free. The majority of the supports were on
the interior of the helmet, and cleanly snapped off when I pried the helmets off the print bed. 
The were minimal exernal supports separated easily, and left no marks behind.

Now to print some minimalist stands to mount the helmets.
