## Curved Wall

Building dungeons with typical purchased dungeon tiles can be an exercise in
frustration - the tiles you have (or don't have) end up dictating the layout
and scope of the dungeon, rather than the story and setting. This curved tile
served as a test print of the OpenForge series tile sets.

I was _very_ happy with the outcome of this tile - it fits well with existing
dungeon tiles, was quick to print, and is sturdy even at 10% infill. This print
definitely passes the test, and a larger print of tiles for a full dungeon is
in the works.
