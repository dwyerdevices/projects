## Name plate

I've seen a few interesting text prints floating around, and have especially liked a few that play
with angles and offsets that make the text pop out in unexpected ways - there somehow reminiscent of
a late 1980's, early 1990's design aesthetic as desktop publishing became a Thing.

As I've been posting print photos to Instagram under Dwyer Devices as well as posting here, I thought
it would be fun to print a name plate for the site, drawing a bit of inspiration from these other text
prints. A straight copy of any of the styles didn't seem quite right, so I designed something with more
of a nod towards 3D printing and melting plastic:

I should have printed this with an attached brim, as multiple points around the edge pulled away
from the print bed. Despite that, I like this turquoise filament - really consistent and solid color.
