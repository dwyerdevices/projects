## Sewer Dungeon - Print 4

We're building a dungeon. This is a project spanning lots of different prints, until
we generate all of the tiles we need for the dungeon we have in mind. The prints
are spread across:

 - Print One - [Sewer Corners](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/24/sewer-dungeon-print-one/)
 - Print Two - [Sewer Tunnel](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/24/sewer-dungeon-print-two/)
 - Print Three - [Corners and Ladders](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/24/sewer-dungeon-print-three/)
 - Print Four - [Deep Pool](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/24/sewer-dungeon-print-4/)
 - Print Five - [Deep Sluice and Deep Pool](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/29/sewer-dungeon-print-five/)
 - Print Six - [Barred Sewer](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/29/sewer-dungeon-print-six/)
 - Print Seven - [ABS Flooring](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/29/sewer-dungeon-print-seven/)
 - Print Eight - [Circular Room Part 1](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/10/02/sewer-dungeon-print-eight/)
 - Print Nine - [Circular Room Part 2](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/10/03/sewer-dungeon-print-nine/)
 - Print Ten - [Circular Room Part 3]()
 
### Print Four - Deep Pool

These turned out really well, and really quickly. Because, of course I did, I neglected
to print the center tile for the deep pool. I'll need to add that to a later batch, likely of more
deep pool tiles to make a larger area. The edges of the pool and the upper face of the curved
corners are built to mesh well with basic floor pieces, which I haven't printed
many of yet - soon to come.

For this set of tiles I added a 2mm brim to see if it made any difference
in the adhesion of the tiles, and to see if it possibly solved the problem
of "peeled away" corners I've seen on other tiles. Worked perfectly, and added
only a few minutes of cleanup post-print. The brims peel away cleanly and quickly
once a corner of the brim has been pulled away from the printed model.
