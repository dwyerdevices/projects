## Sewer Dungeon - Print Three

We're building a dungeon. This is a project spanning lots of different prints, until
we generate all of the tiles we need for the dungeon we have in mind. The prints
are spread across:

 - Print One - [Sewer Corners](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/24/sewer-dungeon-print-one/)
 - Print Two - [Sewer Tunnel](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/24/sewer-dungeon-print-two/)
 - Print Three - [Corners and Ladders](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/24/sewer-dungeon-print-three/)
 - Print Four - [Deep Pool](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/24/sewer-dungeon-print-4/)
 - Print Five - [Deep Sluice and Deep Pool](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/29/sewer-dungeon-print-five/)
 - Print Six - [Barred Sewer](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/29/sewer-dungeon-print-six/)
 - Print Seven - [ABS Flooring](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/29/sewer-dungeon-print-seven/)
 - Print Eight - [Circular Room Part 1](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/10/02/sewer-dungeon-print-eight/)
 - Print Nine - [Circular Room Part 2](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/10/03/sewer-dungeon-print-nine/)
 - Print Ten - [Circular Room Part 3](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/10/05/sewer-dungeon-print-ten/)

### Print Three - Corners and Ladders

I missed a corner in Print Two, and haven't yet done any detail pieces other than the
wall with a pipe, so now is the chance to get both printed. There are a handful of 1x1 square
detail pieces in the Sewer tile set, like ladders and corners that join the concave sewer walls.

The 1x1 detail tiles have terrific adhesion to the print bed; so much so that this print (or, rather, extracting this print from the
printer) resulted in breaking a print trying to remove it from the print bed (first time
for me, but certainly not the last). Ignoring the broken piece, a nice set of tiles:
