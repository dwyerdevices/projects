## OpenForge - Sewer Dungeon

We're building a dungeon. This is a project spanning lots of different prints, until
we generate all of the tiles we need for the dungeon we have in mind. The prints
are spread across:

 - Print One - [Sewer Corners](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/24/sewer-dungeon-print-one/)
 - Print Two - [Sewer Tunnel](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/24/sewer-dungeon-print-two/)
 - Print Three - [Corners and Ladders](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/24/sewer-dungeon-print-three/)
 - Print Four - [Deep Pool](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/24/sewer-dungeon-print-4/)
 - Print Five - [Deep Sluice and Deep Pool](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/29/sewer-dungeon-print-five/)
 - Print Six - [Barred Sewer](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/29/sewer-dungeon-print-six/)
 - Print Seven - [ABS Flooring](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/29/sewer-dungeon-print-seven/)
 - Print Eight - [Circular Room Part 1](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/10/02/sewer-dungeon-print-eight/)
 - Print Nine - [Circular Room Part 2](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/10/03/sewer-dungeon-print-nine/)
 - Print Ten - [Circular Room Part 3](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/10/05/sewer-dungeon-print-ten/)
 - Print Eleven - [Bridges](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/10/06/sewer-dungeon-print-eleven/)
 - Print Twelve - [So Much Sluice](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/10/08/sewer-dungeon-print-twelve/)
 - Print Thirteen - [Magic Portal](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/10/14/sewer-dungeon-print-thirteen/)
 
### Print Six - Barred Sewer

Having a completely open and easy to explore dungeon in the sewer seems like a missed opportunity - so
I'm adding to the mystery (and explorable area) with a barred off section of the sewer. Not sure yet
if the bars will be in place, bent, or broken:

There are four individual pieces to print for this model, and which to print depends on how wide the
barred opening will be. I chose an opening with a 2 block wide sluice between the sides of the sewer,
but printed the bars_top-3x.stl the first time around by mistake, which is too short to span a 2x wide 
sluice tile. The proper 4x wide topper for the bars got added to a later print.
