## Moana Locket

Moana is kind of a big deal, especially around our house. We don't sing songs from Frozen, we
sing songs from Moana. Lo and behold a handful of Moana artifacts on Thingiverse: 
[Maui](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2319779), [Pua and Hei-Hei](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2347073),
somehow not a single good Moana, a [Kakamora Chief](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2369303), and of
particular interest a [Heart of TeFiti](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2371655).

A Heart of TeFiti to call his own could make a five year old very, very happy:

This was printed with dense infill because this is going to take some abuse from a 5 year old. I printed
without a brim, which resulted in the edges of the two halves of the model separating from
the print bed. Without a perfectly flat surface the two halves can't be usefully glued
together, but the single detailed half serves as a good stand in for a complete print.
