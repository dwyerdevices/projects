## Sorting Hat

Friends from Brooklyn dropped by for a morning during the Labor Day long weekend. Their kids had seen, and mostly worked with, a 3D printer at a
Maker Space in Brooklyn, but most of the time that printer is swarmed with users (kids and adults alike). The kids and I sat down and planned
out a few interesting things to print, that would finish quick enough to head home with them.

This was a series of fast prints of a Harry Potter Sorting Hat. The [original model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:501495) was fairly large,
at 10cm to a side, which would take too long to print. So we started small and scaled up; the 25% original model scale took 13 minutes, while a 50% scale with no supports took 40 minutes. The final 50% scale version was made with supports, but wasn't ready by the time everyone left for lunch.

### Print 1

A 25% scaled print of the original Sorting Hat model, with no support structures, on Fast Print settings. Not bad quality
for a draft/fast print, but tiny.

### Print 2

A 50% scale print of the original Sorting Hat, to make it decently bigger than the 25% print. Again, not bad
quality given the settings, but noticable sagging/delamination on the tip of the hat, which hangs horizontally
