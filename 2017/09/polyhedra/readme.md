## Polyhedra

I have a mild obsession with polyhedra. The more complicated, intersecting, stellated, the better. I've
got a stack of books on building polyhedra from paper, variations on polyhedra... it's a bit much sometimes. And
then I stumbled across two things on Thingiverse:

 1. Customizers
 2. A convex polyhedra customizer

I may have lost a few hours to playing with the customizer before I settled on a model and settings. A (fairly) simple
truncated icosidecahedron with thin edges.

I wanted a fairly quick print, to get a feel for the quality and strength of the thin edges, but unfortunatley with
supports enabled (which is a must with the overhangs and minimal vertical stability) this print still took more than
seven hours, even at 0.35mm layers. 

Cleanup was also non-trivial, at 40 minutes. It took a scraper, three shapes of files, a clipper, and a
good amount of brute force to get all of the support structures off. This kind of model is a fantastic
candidate for dissolvable support structures on printers that support multiple filaments during a print. Thankfully
the fully printed icosidodecahedron is stronger than it looks, and stood up well to the abuse needed to clean
it up.
