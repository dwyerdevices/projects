## Update GCODE links in all posts

We had a major fuck-up with all the LFS files and cleaning the repo history, and long story short,
all of the repo links are broken, and now need to point to https://github.com/dwyerdevices/projects

Wait - we have gcode on the SDCard!

## Ornament Tests

Testing out various ornaments in the run up to the holiday season. I want to find one
that is interesting, but quick to print, and easy to cleanup. It's a bit of an ornament
tournament...

## Squishy Owl

The test print of the NinjaFlex went smoothly, so onto the squishy owl. This is a Christmas present
for the 5 year old.

A few false starts, and some fiddling with live z-tuning, and things were printing well. The first print
is nearly perfect, except for the top of the head, where there are too few layers, and too big of a gap
to bridge:

Trying a small second version with a few extra layers, sliced in Slic3r so I can better control a few
things. Well, that resulted in nothing printed, and a bundle of twisted and wasted filament.

## Moon Lamp

First printing a small scale version with the various settings I hope will work for a high
quality and durability print.

The 50% version with variable height layers on the top and bottom failed twice - layer adhesion seemed to be an
issue, and the model portions kept pulling away from the support layer, catching on the PINDA
probe and tearing.

The 15% version with consistent height layers turned out fine - too small for detail to show
through, but it confirms the need for better quality layers at the top of the print, where the
curvature of the sphere makes even high quality layers stretch out and look bad.

Printing a 50% scale version with variable layer heights for the top only turned out fairly well; the
very top was a bit thin, and needs a few extra layers, and "thin walls" detection needs to be turned
on, otherwise quite a nice print. The final version will need to scale up just a bit more.

Medium/NPC Sized: 500% scale
Large Sized: 1000% scale

Trying the medium and large at higher print quality - there aren't a ton of these, and they
are some of the nicer decoration pieces, so it may be worth the time for the better detail of
the smaller layers.

Copper version printed about 1/4 of the way before the spool got tangled, looks like the filament
snapped under tension. grrr.

### Print 5 - Court of Portals

I have quite a few of the pieces for this part of the dungeon already printed, but
need to build out the flooring and the surrounds for each of the portals. The courtyard
at the center of all of the portals is fairly large, at 12 x 12 squares. I'm going to
attempt to fill it with 4x4 tiles, the largest ones I've printed yet.
