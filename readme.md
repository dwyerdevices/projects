## Update GCODE links in all posts

We had a major fuck-up with all the LFS files and cleaning the repo history, and long story short,
all of the repo links are broken, and now need to point to https://github.com/dwyerdevices/projects

Wait - we have gcode on the SDCard!

### Print Eleven - Bridges

No one _wants_ to walk through sluices, much less (possibly) bottomless pools
in the sewers, right? Someone built bridges in this old sewer system, I wonder
why?

### Print Twelve - So Much Sluice

With rough drawings of the dungeon on paper, it's time to start printing up
various pieces in large quantities. This print is batches of sluice curves,
straight pieces, deep pools, and other tiles I've already trialed and started
to arrange into our dungeon.

For each batch, I'm printing 4 copies of a model per print. I've found that I
can fit up to 12 2x2 dungeon tiles onto the print bed, but that has a high print
failure rate, with filament near the edge of the bed having poor adhesion. I could
probably push this up to 6 copies per print without negatively affecting the
print error rate, but 4 copies per print puts each batch at right around 2-3 hours
per print, which makes it easier to fit multiple prints into the day.

I've laid out the entire dungeon on paper in roughly the configuration I want, and
have partially built out tiles for selected areas to gauge which pieces I need
more of.

Most of the low profile tiles are quick to print, but the details pieces, like the
bridges, and the taller pieces, like walls, take a long time to print. I think I've
decided that I won't be walling in the entire dungeon. Strategic places will get
walled in as needed during play, like when line of sight and cover become an
issue. Otherwise, the printing of walls and corner fill alone could take weeks.


By printing out 4-8 of most of the tile variants I'm using, I'll very likely end
up with extra tiles not used in the final layout, which is fine. It'll take slightly
longer over all to print, but makes managing all of the printing much, much easier.

### Print Thirteen - Magical Portal

This dungeon has a larger purpose; a magical portal at the end of the dungeon hints
at a bigger dungeon complex, and story, yet to unfold. This model is an excellent
self contained magic circle that will fit into the existing dungeon layout without
much trouble.

I'm trying a few new print settings for this print. First off, I'm using the 3D honey
comb fill, which should create a stronger infill with less material than other infill
patterns. In an effort to reduce print time even further, I'm testing out Slic3r's feature
for doing thicker infill layers. In this mode the perimeter layers are printed at the
configured layer size (in this case 0.35mm), but the infill layers are printed thicker,
and only laid down every 3 layers.

The combined infill parameters had me a bit wary after the print first started. With a
basic layer quality of 0.35mm, and combined fill every 3 layers, the infill height would
seem to be 1.05mm, which is more than double the extruder size. I've kept a close eye
on the print, and so far everything seems to be working, but the honeycomb infill does
have visible vertical gaps between each layer.

This is also the first print where I've needed to swap in a new filament spool mid
print.
