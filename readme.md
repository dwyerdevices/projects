## Update GCODE links in all posts

We had a major fuck-up with all the LFS files and cleaning the repo history, and long story short,
all of the repo links are broken, and now need to point to https://github.com/dwyerdevices/projects

Wait - we have gcode on the SDCard!

# Sylph

The 10 year old has a project to come up with a 3D representation of a specific vocabulary
word: sylph. Scouring various model sites, and this resampled version of a statue scan from the [Stanford 3D Scanning Repository](http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/) seemed like a good fit. We modified
the model further, by removing most of the base below the feet.

# Ignis - Scientia Dagger

Already sliced

Time comparisons:

 - guard 2: 100 microns = 8 hours 16 minutes, 60 microns = 16 hours 20 minutes
 - blade 1: 100 microns = 9 hours 13 minutes, 60 microns = 15 hours 32 minutes
 
so 932 / 592 = 1.57 and 980 / 496 = 1.98, let's call it ~1.75x more time to go to 60 microns, which
would be just shy of 100 hours of print time at 50 microns, vs ~56 hours at 100 microns.

Use RPG Tools Tiny Village pieces
Use dock pieces

## City in the Sky

What do the adventurers need to do in the City in the Sky? 

1. Find a contact (who sends them astray) from the undermountain guild member
2. Get ambused at the water market
3. Get sent to the wrong back alley
4. Figure out which guild is allied with the horrid dragon
5. Sneak into the guild
6. Steal the keystones that open the portal from the guild
7. Discover that a guild master resides in the clock tower, and has a portal key
8. Break into the clock tower (fight on the roof?)
9. Steal back the portal stone
10. Destroy the nest of flying creatures that will wreak havoc on the city

## Print 5 - Water Market


## Print 4 - Raised Canals

Canals held aloft on stone arch ways connect parts of the city.

## Print 3 -  Edges of the City

At various points parts of the city just fall away to nothing, with only simple
railings and barricades keeping the less wary adventurer from tipping over the edge.

The entry point from the magic circle into the City is hidden in an old courtyard
bordering the edge of the city, with the facade of an old multi-storey building blocking
the courtyard from the canalway.


### Print 2 - Canal Test

A tile set of Canals - Embankments and water tiles that snap-fit to keep larger arrangements
together more easily. This set builds on the [smooth stone tiles](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:234325) of [devonjones](https://www.thingiverse.com/devonjones) for the
embankments. Mostly compatible with OpenForge.

https://www.instagram.com/p/Bc8bcybgpB8/?taken-by=dwyerdevices

For this tile set I wanted to transition from embankment to water partway through a tile square,
with part of the tile filled with embankment, and part with water. The embankment tile corners and
edges are designed with this in mind.

https://www.instagram.com/p/Bc8bDAbAhjj/?taken-by=dwyerdevices

https://www.instagram.com/p/Bc8bLWGgN4O/?taken-by=dwyerdevices

The embankment tiles have multiple snap fit points, so each tile is easy to fit into any 
arrangement of water. For bodies of water wider that 5 squares, or for joining multiple canals
together, there are water tiles with snap fit connectors at a single end, so the end without
a snap-fit connector can abut another water tile, or any other type of tile. 

https://www.instagram.com/p/BcvbOw4Adfs/?taken-by=dwyerdevices

First version of the design has problems when fitting corners together - the overlaps just don't
work:

This design went through a fairly quick evolution, from a simple fit, to
individual snap-fit guides, to the current snap-fit design:

https://www.instagram.com/p/Bcvaiyegy_G/?taken-by=dwyerdevices

I ended up with a snap-fit design that allows for water tiles to be fit in easily
at any offset along the tile edge:

Trying the medium and large at higher print quality - there aren't a ton of these, and they
are some of the nicer decoration pieces, so it may be worth the time for the better detail of
the smaller layers.

Copper version printed about 1/4 of the way before the spool got tangled, looks like the filament
snapped under tension. grrr.

### Print 5 - Court of Portals

I have quite a few of the pieces for this part of the dungeon already printed, but
need to build out the flooring and the surrounds for each of the portals. The courtyard
at the center of all of the portals is fairly large, at 12 x 12 squares. I'm going to
attempt to fill it with 4x4 tiles, the largest ones I've printed yet.
