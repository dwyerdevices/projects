### First tests - vertical earrings

First print didn't take - lost adhesion before the third layer even printed. Trying a second time, no modifications.

Second print failed as well, just not getting the layers down and clean.

## Journal - Header Stencil - Trial 1

The first attempt at a stencil - already looking at the print bed it seems like the
letter forms will be too narrow to be useful. Need to find a good way of building
text through-holes that have better structure and width.

## Journal - Header Stencil - Trial 2

Second printing attempt - much quicker to build out the base layer, but the issue
of the letter forms being to narrow persists. Need to find a better way of scaling
out the letter width.

Switching to 10% infill / Triangles

## Stacking Box - Single - Fast Print

Another print of the Stackable Box I [modified into the Keep Box](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2017/09/07/keep-me/). This
print was an experiment of sorts: how did print quality affect the feel and durability of a utility item like
a project tray? Visually the boxes are almost identical in detail and shape.

This print _does_ feel less durable; the density and precision of the layers along the sides of the box are obvious 
when you pick up and manipulate the box. The faster print doesn't feel _cheap_, but it does feel less rigid. It's a 
trade off - a flimsier box in less than half the print time. In some cases that trade off is worth it, but for any 
boxes that will be moved around or otherwise manipulated regularly, I'd still go with the longer, more durable print.

## Keep Tray

Quick print - a box for bits and pieces easily mistaken for cast-offs or trimmings from other prints. Helpful for 
holding filament clips and other frequently used tools.

## Filament spool clips

Incredibly useful for keeping spools of filament from unwinding, and very quick to print, making them a fantastic
test print for new filament. Very easy to print out multiples.
