## Idle Time - Feature or Bug? 

Idle time during a paused print counts towards the overall print time. Weird. Or it counts to the wall clock time, but the
overall print time is correct. Interesting.

### Print One - Corner

Partially a test print of the sewer tiles. A bend in the sewer tunnel, or a covex
corner in a larger sewer sluice pool. Very clean print, again. These tiles are quick,
easy, and very very sturdy. Some issues with adhesion on the first few layers of the
larger 2x2 tiles which is causing the corners to pull away from the print bed, but the
upper surfaces of the print are unaffected.

### Print Two - Sewer Tunnel

This print has failed twice already due to loose bed adhesion. It's covering nearly
the entire printable surface, but the pieces are disconnected, so any irregularities
or unevenness in the print bed are hard to correct for.

### Print Three - Corners and Ladders

I missed a corner in Print Two, and haven't yet done any detail pieces other than the
wall with a pipe, so now is the chance. The 1x1 tiles have terrific adhesion to the
print bed; so much so that this print (or, rather, extracting this print from the
printer) resulted in breaking a print trying to remove it from the print bed (first time
for me, but certainly not the last).
