## That's one big pile of ABS

A print of "all_the_filaments" failed spectacularly, leaving a big ball of ABS wrapped around the hot end. Not
the best way to find the printer. I set the hot-end to pre-heat for ABS, and was able to cleanly pull the ball
off at about 120 degrees.

## Idle Time - Feature or Bug? 

Idle time during a paused print counts towards the overall print time. Weird.

## Poke-set

0.35mm layers (Fast Print)
White PLA
10% infill
SUpports
Support only on build plate
Glue on print bed

gcode: 

Charmander fire snapped off with light play. Bottom faces of all of them are messy.

## Name plate

0.10mm layers
no supports
1.75mm Turquoise PLA
Print Date: 2017/09/18
Print time: ?
20% cubic infill

Should have printed with an attached brim, as multiple points around the edge are pulling away
from the print bed.

I do like this turquoise filament - really consistent solid color.

That was a non-trivial amount of cleanup (40 minutes)

## Modeling Ruler v1.0

Seems like a very quick print - 10cm isn't big :)

Faults: 
 - text wasn't tall enough, didn't get printed. 
 - 5mm notches are hard to see in low light
 - right angle and curve notch-ins aren't all that useful
 
Pros:
 - Sizing insets for 1, 2, 5, 20mm work really well
 - Quarter circle insets are helpful
 - Right angle of the largest quarter circle made a fantastic square edge
 - light and easy to wedge into (and keep in) a drawing pad, almost like a bookmark
 - clean edges made for good drafting quality
