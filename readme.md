No supports
1.75mm Translucent Green PETG (cnzhehan.com)


### Deck Box #1

After needing a full recalibration (that's a fun error message), and spending 20 minutes Live Adjusting the Z axis during test
prints, I could finally attempt the first of the eight prints for the CCG Deck box. It took 3 attempts, and various layer adhesion
problems, before I remembered that PETG was my nemesis, and I had to use glue stick on the print bed. With glue applied, the first
section of the box was well under way.
