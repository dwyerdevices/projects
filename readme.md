## Idle Time - Feature or Bug? 

Idle time during a paused print counts towards the overall print time. Weird. Or it counts to the wall clock time, but the
overall print time is correct. Interesting.

## Poke-set

0.35mm layers (Fast Print)
White PLA
10% infill
SUpports
Support only on build plate
Glue on print bed

Charmander fire snapped off with light play. Bottom faces of all of them are messy.

## Name plate

0.10mm layers
no supports
1.75mm Turquoise PLA
Print Date: 2017/09/18
Print time: ?
20% cubic infill

Should have printed with an attached brim, as multiple points around the edge are pulling away
from the print bed.

I do like this turquoise filament - really consistent solid color.

That was a non-trivial amount of cleanup (40 minutes)

## Ruined Walls

Let's build a dungeon.

Zero surface prep, and a really quick print. Hole through the wall ended up with a few dangling
threads of filament. Easy to get off the bed as well.
