## Jewelry Test - Oriental Earrings

### First tests - vertical earrings

First print didn't take - lost adhesion before the third layer even printed. Trying a second time, no modifications.

Second print failed as well, just not getting the layers down and clean.

## Journal - Header Stencil - Trial 1

The first attempt at a stencil - already looking at the print bed it seems like the
letter forms will be too narrow to be useful. Need to find a good way of building
text through-holes that have better structure and width.

## Journal - Header Stencil - Trial 2

Second printing attempt - much quicker to build out the base layer, but the issue
of the letter forms being to narrow persists. Need to find a better way of scaling
out the letter width.

Switching to 10% infill / Triangles

## Filament spool clips

Incredibly useful for keeping spools of filament from unwinding, and very quick to print, making them a fantastic
test print for new filament. Very easy to print out multiples.
