## Update GCODE links in all posts

We had a major fuck-up with all the LFS files and cleaning the repo history, and long story short,
all of the repo links are broken, and now need to point to https://github.com/dwyerdevices/projects

Wait - we have gcode on the SDCard!

### Print Eleven - Bridges

No one _wants_ to walk through sluices, much less (possibly) bottomless pools
in the sewers, right? Someone built bridges in this old sewer system, I wonder
why?

### Print Twelve - So Much Sluice

With rough drawings of the dungeon on paper, it's time to start printing up
various pieces in large quantities. This print is batches of sluice curves,
straight pieces, deep pools, and other tiles I've already trialed and started
to arrange into our dungeon.

For each batch, I'm printing 4 copies of a model per print. I've found that I
can fit up to 12 2x2 dungeon tiles onto the print bed, but that has a high print
failure rate, with filament near the edge of the bed having poor adhesion. I could
probably push this up to 6 copies per print without negatively affecting the
print error rate, but 4 copies per print puts each batch at right around 2-3 hours
per print, which makes it easier to fit multiple prints into the day.

I've laid out the entire dungeon on paper in roughly the configuration I want, and
have partially built out tiles for selected areas to gauge which pieces I need
more of. 



Most of the low profile tiles are quick to print, but the details pieces, like the
bridges, and the taller pieces, like walls, take a long time to print. I think I've
decided that I won't be walling in the entire dungeon. Strategic places will get
walled in as needed during play, like when line of sight and cover become an
issue. Otherwise, the printing of walls and corner fill alone could take weeks.
