## Cleaning the PEI Bed

Tried: Isopropyl Wipes
Result: for a small bit of glue it might work, but for a larger surface, this just doesn't help

Tried: Nail polish remover
Result: Turns the glue back to a sticky surface, but doesn't remove it

Tried: Damp paper towl on headed bed (h/t: Mark Fuller https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azjci3GOAYQ)
Result: It took a few cycles, but this worked better than anything yet.
