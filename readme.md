## Update GCODE links in all posts

We had a major fuck-up with all the LFS files and cleaning the repo history, and long story short,
all of the repo links are broken, and now need to point to https://github.com/dwyerdevices/projects

Wait - we have gcode on the SDCard!

## Ornament Tests

Testing out various ornaments in the run up to the holiday season. I want to find one
that is interesting, but quick to print, and easy to cleanup. It's a bit of an ornament
tournament...

## Gift Boxes

A few gift boxes for small presents.

The scaled down version was intended for small gifts, like jewelry, but ended up
being very hard to close, and even harder to open. Seems like the mixture of scaling
and print quality didn't lend itself to the original tolerances between the top and
bottom of the box.

The Gift Card size box turns out to be fairly quick to print, and well sized for
jewelry:

## Squishy Owl

The test print of the NinjaFlex went smoothly, so onto the squishy owl. This is a Christmas present
for the 5 year old.

A few false starts, and some fiddling with live z-tuning, and things were printing well. The first print
is nearly perfect, except for the top of the head, where there are too few layers, and too big of a gap
to bridge:

https://www.instagram.com/p/Bbz048DAeHb/?taken-by=dwyerdevices

Trying a small second version with a few extra layers, sliced in Slic3r so I can better control a few
things. Well, that resulted in nothing printed, and a bundle of twisted and wasted filament.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BdDmv9zAhJQ/?taken-by=dwyerdevices

Adding a tophat to see if we can cover up the spotty quality on the top of the owl's head.

## Seven Oases


### Print 2 - 

What leads from the portal to the city?


## City in the Sky

### Print 2 - Canal Test

A tile set of Canals - Embankments and water tiles that snap-fit to keep larger arrangements
together more easily. This set builds on the [smooth stone tiles](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:234325) of [devonjones](https://www.thingiverse.com/devonjones) for the
embankments. Mostly compatible with OpenForge.

https://www.instagram.com/p/Bc8bcybgpB8/?taken-by=dwyerdevices

For this tile set I wanted to transition from embankment to water partway through a tile square,
with part of the tile filled with embankment, and part with water. The embankment tile corners and
edges are designed with this in mind.

https://www.instagram.com/p/Bc8bDAbAhjj/?taken-by=dwyerdevices

https://www.instagram.com/p/Bc8bLWGgN4O/?taken-by=dwyerdevices

The embankment tiles have multiple snap fit points, so each tile is easy to fit into any 
arrangement of water. For bodies of water wider that 5 squares, or for joining multiple canals
together, there are water tiles with snap fit connectors at a single end, so the end without
a snap-fit connector can abut another water tile, or any other type of tile. 

https://www.instagram.com/p/BcvbOw4Adfs/?taken-by=dwyerdevices

First version of the design has problems when fitting corners together - the overlaps just don't
work:

https://www.instagram.com/p/BcjGKL3geLl/?taken-by=dwyerdevices

This design went through a fairly quick evolution, from a simple fit, to
individual snap-fit guides, to the current snap-fit design:

https://www.instagram.com/p/Bcvaiyegy_G/?taken-by=dwyerdevices

I ended up with a snap-fit design that allows for water tiles to be fit in easily
at any offset along the tile edge:

### Small Griffins

One of the environments in an upcoming adventure is dotted with statues of griffins - the symbol
of the once glorius City in the Sky.

Slic3r couldn't handle the complex GCode when it was time to estimate filament and print
time, so I've switched over to Cura for slicing this print.

Trying the medium and large at higher print quality - there aren't a ton of these, and they
are some of the nicer decoration pieces, so it may be worth the time for the better detail of
the smaller layers.

Copper version printed about 1/4 of the way before the spool got tangled, looks like the filament
snapped under tension. grrr.

### Print 5 - Court of Portals

I have quite a few of the pieces for this part of the dungeon already printed, but
need to build out the flooring and the surrounds for each of the portals. The courtyard
at the center of all of the portals is fairly large, at 12 x 12 squares. I'm going to
attempt to fill it with 4x4 tiles, the largest ones I've printed yet.
