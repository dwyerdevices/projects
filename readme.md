## Update GCODE links in all posts

We had a major fuck-up with all the LFS files and cleaning the repo history, and long story short,
all of the repo links are broken, and now need to point to https://github.com/dwyerdevices/projects

### Print Eight - Circular Room Part 1

A circular room inset in a larger dungeon is going to play a part in this upcoming adventure. This
print covers the curved walls of the room, while a series of future prints will add in the outside
tiles to square out our floor against the curved wall, as well as a door, some straight walls, and
a few filler floor tiles.

### Print Eleven - Bridges

No one _wants_ to walk through sluices, much less (possibly) bottomless pools
in the sewers, right? Someone built bridges in this old sewer system, I wonder
why?

### Print Thirteen - Stone

Sewer Stone 2x2 x6

## Bestiary - Goblins

## Bestiary - Crocodiles

The upcoming adventure through the sewers requires a creature(s) lurking in the deep, murky pools
into which the sluices empty. How about crocodiles?

<<>>

This is my first print from [YouMagine](https://www.youmagine.com), but given how many creatures
I've already found there, I doubt my last.

## Bestiary - Goblin Dog

I'm going to use Hyenas as a proxy for Goblin Dogs in this adventure. The Hatchbox Copper ABS loaded a bit
strangely; lots of popping, and the extruded filament almost looks aerated.

There was a ton of clean up for these, and being delicate, two of them didn't make it. The base of the support
plate under the Hyena at the base of the figurine still has a few layers of support material on it, which I'm
not going to clean up, otherwise I'd probably lose most of the rest of the figurines.
