## Update GCODE links in all posts

We had a major fuck-up with all the LFS files and cleaning the repo history, and long story short,
all of the repo links are broken, and now need to point to https://github.com/dwyerdevices/projects

Wait - we have gcode on the SDCard!

## RPG Tools

The models of the RPG Tools Kickstarter have come through, and we're printing up as many
as we can.


### Airship

Why not start with an airship? This is a large, multi-part model that will take some time
to piece together.


First prints took a bit more than 2x longer than expected, and it looks like the models had
surface normalization issues prior to slicing, with large chunks of the three base pieces missing
in the printed versions. Salvagable, but we'll need to fix the files and reprint for a
full version of the airship.

## Seven Oases


### Print 2 - 

What leads from the portal to the city?


## City in the Sky

### Print 2 - Canal Test

A tile set of Canals - Embankments and water tiles that snap-fit to keep larger arrangements
together more easily. This set builds on the [smooth stone tiles](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:234325) of [devonjones](https://www.thingiverse.com/devonjones) for the
embankments. Mostly compatible with OpenForge.

https://www.instagram.com/p/Bc8bcybgpB8/?taken-by=dwyerdevices

For this tile set I wanted to transition from embankment to water partway through a tile square,
with part of the tile filled with embankment, and part with water. The embankment tile corners and
edges are designed with this in mind.

https://www.instagram.com/p/Bc8bDAbAhjj/?taken-by=dwyerdevices

https://www.instagram.com/p/Bc8bLWGgN4O/?taken-by=dwyerdevices

The embankment tiles have multiple snap fit points, so each tile is easy to fit into any 
arrangement of water. For bodies of water wider that 5 squares, or for joining multiple canals
together, there are water tiles with snap fit connectors at a single end, so the end without
a snap-fit connector can abut another water tile, or any other type of tile. 

https://www.instagram.com/p/BcvbOw4Adfs/?taken-by=dwyerdevices

First version of the design has problems when fitting corners together - the overlaps just don't
work:

https://www.instagram.com/p/BcjGKL3geLl/?taken-by=dwyerdevices

This design went through a fairly quick evolution, from a simple fit, to
individual snap-fit guides, to the current snap-fit design:

https://www.instagram.com/p/Bcvaiyegy_G/?taken-by=dwyerdevices

I ended up with a snap-fit design that allows for water tiles to be fit in easily
at any offset along the tile edge:

Trying the medium and large at higher print quality - there aren't a ton of these, and they
are some of the nicer decoration pieces, so it may be worth the time for the better detail of
the smaller layers.

Copper version printed about 1/4 of the way before the spool got tangled, looks like the filament
snapped under tension. grrr.

### Print 5 - Court of Portals

I have quite a few of the pieces for this part of the dungeon already printed, but
need to build out the flooring and the surrounds for each of the portals. The courtyard
at the center of all of the portals is fairly large, at 12 x 12 squares. I'm going to
attempt to fill it with 4x4 tiles, the largest ones I've printed yet.
