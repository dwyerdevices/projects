## Idle Time - Feature or Bug? 

Idle time during a paused print counts towards the overall print time. Weird. Or it counts to the wall clock time, but the
overall print time is correct. Interesting.

## Ruined Walls

Let's build a dungeon.

Zero surface prep, and a really quick print. Hole through the wall ended up with a few dangling
threads of filament. Easy to get off the bed as well.
