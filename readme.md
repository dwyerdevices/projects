! create a font test for stencil post

! start list in repo of print ideas


## Update GCODE links in all posts

We had a major fuck-up with all the LFS files and cleaning the repo history, and long story short,
all of the repo links are broken, and now need to point to https://github.com/dwyerdevices/projects

Wait - we have gcode on the SDCard!


## Bracelet

!! First print failed when the printer wouldn't resume after pausing over night. Bed would heat up, but the 
hotend set itself for 0°.

!! Rescale

## Blade of Marmora

Eventually we'll print out a version that has a glowing gem stone.

### Printing

I'm going to pick materials for the various components of this model that elimintates
the need to do any painting, or at least minimizes the amount of painting required on
the finished blade. Eventually we'll build a version with embedded batter and electronics
to make the gem stone glow, but for now a non-glowing translucent blue gemstone will need to do.

### Print ? - Alls the Walls

Batch printing walls.

Interesting to note: when generating the estimates for print time and filament, PrusaControl wouldn't load
the full STL or generated GCODE I built in Slic3r - it just locked up the entire computer, nearly causing
a full hard boot. For the estimates, I used the base wall tile, and scaled up by a factor of 12.

## Bestiary - Ghosts

Why wouldn't you want to have a set of green ghosts around? Especially if your adventurers might
be snooping around tombs. Ancient tombs, at that. There may even be mummies about. Boo.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BaphXXaAXbs/?taken-by=dwyerdevices

The ghosts were hard to clean up. None of the heads came through attached, and on one of the ghosts the arms 
came off with the supports. They'll still work (ok, _headless_ ghosts) for the purpose of this adventure, but
I do need to figure out a better way to print them.
