# Ships - Scaled Up Space Station

Going through the various Kickstarter projects we've backed recently, picking some models from each
to print and test out. From the [SciFi Structures Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1419392625/printable-scifi-structures-stl-file-pack-for-table), the
Space Station - **space_station_repaired.stl**

This is a scaled up version of the previous Space Station - hopefully being a bit bigger, and
a bit denser, will give it some longevity in the hands of active kids.
