# Netherforge Jotunkiller

From [Dutch Mogul](https://www.myminifactory.com/users/dutchmogul), the Jotunkiller was released on Thingiverse
as part of a promotion for the [Scatterblocks Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/292543184/scatterblocks).

> "Forged from shadowsteel and given life by the embers of a dying god, the Jotunkiller was the the dwarves' greatest weapon in their war against giant-kind, and still stands as a guardian of the Netherforge."

A test print of the arm models for the Jotunkiller with Bronze PLA was really successful, bringing out the detail
of the models nicely:

The finished version required fairly significant clean up time, as the Tree Supports I used for the main
body of the creature formed an almost solid wrapper around the print. But after careful, if prolonged, cleanup,
the result was fantastic:
