# Park Bench

Roughly based on a common style of bench in New York City's Central Park. There are two
leg widths, and two bench widths in this set. The bench slat widths are 100mm and 170mm, allowing
for a wide or compact bench. The legs are provided in 4mm width and 7mm width.

## Scaling

If you take a standard Central Park bench height as 80cm, or 800mm, tall, a 12:1 scaling would give
you a miniature bench 66.7mm tall - this would mean **printing at approximately 70% ** of this model scale.

## Printing

All of the pieces are provided as individual STLs. You will need to print:

 - **2 legs**
 - **7 slats**

The two legs can easily be printed together, even in a small print volume, by rotating one leg 180Â° and
nesting the legs close together. 

I've tested the print with the **legs sliced with 0.06mm layers** and **slats sliced with 0.20mm layers**.

## Assembly

Depending on your layer size when slicing, the slats will fit more or less snug to the legs. A small
bit of glue between each leg and slat should be sufficient. Getting everything aligned and glued takes
a bit of trial-and-error, but I recommend attaching two or three bench (not back) slats to one leg, and
letting them dry for a few minutes. Once those slats are dried, attach them to the other leg to stabalize
and balance the whole miniature. Then procede slat by slat to complete the model.
