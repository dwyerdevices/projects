# Paint Rack

One day you have no enamel paints, the next day you've got 23 jars. I needed some way of storing
all of my enamel paints, getting them out of the way, while not hiding them away in a drawer. Why
not print a solution?

Each rack holds four jars of Testor enamel or acrylic paint, with the jars tilted to 45Â° for easy
access. Three variable width mounting holes on the back of the rack allow easy fitting to most small
head nails and screws, making wall mounting quick and stable.
