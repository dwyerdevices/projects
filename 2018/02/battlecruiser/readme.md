# Ships - Battlecruiser

Going through the various Kickstarter projects we've backed recently, picking some models from each
to print and test out. From the [SciFi Structures Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1419392625/printable-scifi-structures-stl-file-pack-for-table), the **battlecruiser_repaired.stl**.

This is the first of the Project Mobius series that I've printed, and I learned a few things in the process. Transparent materials
don't work well for these small detail ships - the look of the edges is lost in the shadows of the infill that show through the
surface. Supports are a bit of a nightmare to clean up - lots of small spaces and thin surfaces make it difficult to differentiate
between supports and features. The higher the infill, the better: the ships take a beating in the hands of kids, and the denser they
are, the longer they survive.
