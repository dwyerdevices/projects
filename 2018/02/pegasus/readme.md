# Bestiary - Pegasus

Testing out a few things on this print: the experimental branching tree supports of _Cura 3.2_, and 80% infill on a creature
to better support delicate features. If this is successful we're printing two of these: one for our collection, 
one for one of the 10 year old's friends at school.

While prepping the model, it seems like Cura 3.2 is a bit buggy when it comes to enabling Tree Support mode, or loading a model when Tree Support
is already enabled - to trigger slicing it is sometimes necessary to toggle Tree Support off and then on again to
start slicing.

Printing the wings is a bit of a nightmare - I couldn't get them to print in their vertical orientation with tree
supports, but was successful rotating them to be as flat as possible, and adding supports everywhere.
