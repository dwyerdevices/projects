### Modding the Broken Airship

It would be a terrible waste to throw away the parts of the [failed airship](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2018/01/25/airship-1-model-errors/), as
it we'd be tossing 50+ hours of printing, so we'll add some parts and continue to use it, possibly as a previously decommissioned airship
renovated and modded by some faction or gruop in the City in the Sky.

The rear hard-points were still intact, so those get wings and jets:

I won't put much more work into this piece unless the adventure calls for it.
