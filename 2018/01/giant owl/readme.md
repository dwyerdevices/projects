# Bestiary - Giant Owl

I've been getting consistently better prints, with finer quality layers, better supports,
and fewer errors, using Cura 3 for slicing, compared to Slic3r. I've had a number of prints
that failed, or had marginal errors, when slicing and printing creatures at 28mm scale. I
decided to try my luck with Cura on a Giant Owl:

I did end up needing to reslice the owl to add brim/plate adhesion, as the supports for one of the wings pulled up
twice in a row, breaking the print, but the print itself was excellent. A good addition to the
bestiary, and a promising dive back into high quality creatures for gaming.
