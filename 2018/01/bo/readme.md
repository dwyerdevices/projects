## Chinese Bo - Warring States Period

High quality bell making started in China somewhere around 400-300 BCE, more than a thousand years
before bellfounding became well understood in western Europe. As an example of ancient Chinese technologies, it
fits well into the 10 year old's group project at school.

This bell predates the time period they're studying by a few hundred years, dating from the Warring States period,
but was a great example to print up for the 10 year old's group to have on hand.

Like the Terracotta [warrior](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2018/01/31/terracotta-army-warrior-4/) and [horse](http://www.dwyerdevices.com/2018/02/02/terracotta-army-horse/), this bell (also by Scan the World) has large scale surface features, but
little fine detail, making 0.15mm layers acceptable. Which is good, as it would have taken a bit over 40 hours
to print at 0.06mm layer size.
