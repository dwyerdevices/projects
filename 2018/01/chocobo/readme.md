# Chocobo - Figurine

At full scale and fine resolution, this would take a little over 4 days just to print the body of
the chocobo. I want more along the lines of action figure / 38mm scale, so I initially printed at 25% of original
model scale. At that scale it's a bit to small - clean up is difficult, and some of the head feathers of
the chocobo got really messy. 

Reslicing at 33% of original scale, and reprinting, lead to a much better outcome:

While the body is printed in PLA, the feet are printed in ABS, and require a bit of glue:
