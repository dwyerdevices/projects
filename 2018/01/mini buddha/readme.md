## High Detail Printing - Great Buddha

The [Scan the World](https://www.myminifactory.com/users/Scan%20The%20World) collection on MyMiniFactory has some great pieces spanning
world history. For a number of reasons, this scan of the Great Buddha at Kamakura caught my eye.

I did two test prints with this model, working for the first time with 0.06mm layer height during slicing in Cura. I was blown away 
by the quality and consistency of these prints - surfaces were smooth, with layers
being nearly indistinguishable on vertical or linear surfaces, and fine details showing up like they never have
in previous prints I've done.
