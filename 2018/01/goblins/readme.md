## Bestiary - Goblins

For the adventure through the sewers we'd been using cardboard tokens for Goblins. Earlier
attempts to print goblins (sliced with Slic3r) failed spectacularly, but I wanted to try
again slicing with Cura to see if we couldn't get something that worked. It was a success:

The arms, legs, and weapons of these to goblin variants are extremely thin. The first
print used 80% infill to strengthen the model, with a standard support line width of 0.4mm. This
was difficult, bordering on impossible, to cleanup without damaging parts of the model.
Subsequent prints remained at 80% infill density, but switched to a thinner support line
width of 0.2mm, which made a gigantic difference at cleanup time.

The red copper PLA was perfect for skin tone, and after a small bit of detail paint
the goblins are ready to go:
