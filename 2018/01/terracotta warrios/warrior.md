### Terracotta Army - Warrior 4

The 10 year old has a group project (we've already begun to teach him to despise group projects) at school researching
technology in ancient China. Fortuitously we recently visited the Terracotta Army traveling exhibit at the Virgina Museum of
Fine Arts, so the topic was fresh in our minds. 

As luck would have it, some items from the Terracotta Army have been scanned by Scan the World, including one of the kneeling
warriors:

We'll need to see what else we can find as hands on props for their group project.

This was also a great excuse to break out the Red Copper PLA; terracotta colored PLA seems to exist, but is either very hard to
find in stock, or is shockingly expensive.
