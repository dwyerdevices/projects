# Bestiary - Bulette

Minions of a dangerous foe have a captive Bulette barely contained in a cage deep in the
Undermountain. Nearly berserk with rage, the Bulette is likely as dangerous to the captors
as to the adventurers.

Post print this model was relative easy to clean up, with support material holding up the
bulk of the body:
