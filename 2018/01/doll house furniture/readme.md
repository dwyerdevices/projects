# Doll House Furniture

A piece of doll-house scale furniture broke as the kids were cavorting
around the living room - the project for the morning became designing a replacement,
as well as a chair to go with the table. The table is modeled after our
dining room table:

The chair was modeled from scratch without reference material:
