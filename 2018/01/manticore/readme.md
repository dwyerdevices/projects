# Bestiary - Manticore

A Manticore joins the bestiary of interesting (and quite dangerous) creatures queued up for the adventurers.

The manticore is modeled as five separate pieces. Cleaning up printed sections took a fair amount of
effort, as did filing down the wing joints to properly attach to the body. A time consuming build,
but a nice result in the end.
