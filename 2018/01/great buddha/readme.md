## The Great Buddha at Kamakura

I had just acquired some Red Copper Tianse PLA, had recently begun seriously
perusing the [Scan the World](https://www.myminifactory.com/users/Scan%20The%20World) collection on MyMiniFactory,
and the house felt like it needed a decent Buddha statue - lucky for me I found a
scan of the [Great Buddha at Kamakura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K≈çtoku-in), Japan.

This Buddha is shaped such that minimal supports were required during the print:

The scan has a moderately low polygon count, so the geometry tessellation is apparent
if you look for it, but I think the result is still fantastic:

Now to find a good spot in the house for this Buddha to live...
